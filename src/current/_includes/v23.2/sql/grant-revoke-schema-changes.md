User/role management operations (such as [`GRANT`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/grant.md %}) and [`REVOKE`]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/revoke.md %})) are [schema changes]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/online-schema-changes.md %}).  As such they inherit the [limitations of schema changes]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/online-schema-changes.md %}#limitations).

For example, schema changes wait for concurrent [transactions]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/transactions.md %}) using the same resources as the schema changes to complete. In the case of [role memberships]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/security-reference/authorization.md %}#roles) being modified inside a transaction, most transactions need access to the set of role memberships. Using the default settings, any modifications to roles require schema leases to expire, which can take up to 5 minutes.

This means that [long-running transactions]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/query-behavior-troubleshooting.md %}#hanging-or-stuck-queries) elsewhere in the system can cause user/role management operations inside transactions to take several minutes to complete. This can have a cascading effect. When a user/role management operation inside a transaction takes a long time to complete, it can in turn block all user-initiated transactions being run by your application, since the user/role management operation in the transaction has to commit before any other transactions that access role memberships (i.e., most transactions) can make progress.

If you want user/role management operations to finish more quickly, and do not care whether concurrent transactions will immediately see the side-effects of those operations, set the [session variable]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/set-vars.md %}) `allow_role_memberships_to_change_during_transaction` to `true`.

When enabled, this session variable means that any user/role management operations issued in the current session will only need to wait for the completion of statements in other sessions which do not have that session variable set. To accelerate user/role management operations across your entire application, you can set the session variable in all sessions by [passing it in the client connection string]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/connection-parameters.md %}#supported-options-parameters).
